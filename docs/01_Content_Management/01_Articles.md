## Adding & editing articles

### Adding an article
There are two ways of adding a new article - either through admin bar at top, under _Shortcuts>Ny artikkel_ (1) or on Work Area tabs _Create_ content (2).

Using the _Create content_ option will bring you to a new screen in which you can select the content type _Article_.

#### Content editing

Articles rely on a <a href="http://www.newsfront.no">Newsfront</a> built-in WYSIWYG editor which allows you to add some basic formatting to paragraphs. Most of them you should be familiar with from other word processors like Microsoft Word.

It’s much like using a regular word processor, with toolbar buttons that allow you to Bold or Italicize text or enter in Headings or bullet points.

You can even use most of the basic keyboard shortcuts used in other text editors. For example: _Shift+Enter_ inserts a line break, _Ctrl+C/Cmd+C_ = copy, _Ctrl+X/Cmd+X_ = cut, _Ctrl+Z/Cmd+Z_ = undo, _Ctrl+Y/Cmd+Y_ = redo, _Ctrl+A/Cmd +A_ = select all, etc. (use the Ctrl key on a PC or the Command key on a Mac).

The _Source view_ will enable you to view the HTML code that makes up your content. For the more experienced users this can be helpful at times but for those not familiar with HTML tags, it’s not recommended.

You might find the _Distracting free writing mode_ very useful. It allows to be on a sort off full screen mode within your browser window.

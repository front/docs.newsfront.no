Some Newsfront sites have been upgraded to our new Media system. Here's how it works!

## Uploading images for an article
***1. Click "Select Media"*** to find all the images you will use for the article. 

***2. Upload new images*** by "drag and drop"

***3. Library: Find an existing image***

***4. Decide your main image*** for the article. Note that they will not appear anywhere when they have yellow bacground; you need to drag & drop your image into the Main image spot. For most sites, you only need to use Main image. Some sites however, need some extra flexibility to add separate images for different contexts. For most cases, just adding one image (Main) works great.


**Coming soon image cropping!**

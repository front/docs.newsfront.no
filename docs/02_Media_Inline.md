It is now easier than ever to work with inline media. This new system is still being tested however, so feel free to send your feedback to perandre@front.no.

**1. Upload all the images you need**
Click Select media, and follow the standard flow here: http://docs.newsfront.no/Media

**2. Place your mouse cursor** on the line you want the image to appear. Remember to hit Enter first, so you have a new line for the image.

**3. Click the Media image symbol** in the editor toolbar

**4. Choose an image from the library**

**5. Align the image and add caption**, either: Left, Right or Centered. These are different width and alignment settings for the image (test them, and see what they look like!). 

Enter an alt tag, and also check off to get an image caption.

View the result instantly, but remember to save

Good luck!

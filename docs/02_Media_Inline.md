**1. Upload all the images you need**
Click Select media, and follow the standard flow here: http://docs.newsfront.no/Media

**2. Place your mouse cursor** on the line you want the image to appear. Remember to hit Enter first, so you have a new line for the image.

**3. Click the Media image symbol** in the editor toolbar

**4. Choose an image from the library**

**5. Pick a view mode, either: Full-width, half-width or small-width (test them, and see what they look like!).

Save article, and view the result.

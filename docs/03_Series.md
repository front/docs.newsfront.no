A series is set of articles that can be display on a front page. They also get their own landing page.

Here's how to create a Series:

- Add a new Widget
- Give it a name that looks good to the end user
- Edit the widget title and body field (sub title is rarely used)
- Reference the articles you want (the input auto completes the title for you)
- Upload an image. This will typically look best if it's totally square. It will be resized and rounded automagically.

Before we save it, let's position it properly on the front page:

- Set Type: Series, and Position: Home page series (or wherever your preconfigured positions are)
- Give it a weight to sort the order among the other Series you want displayed

***Save**

That's it!

An admin has full access to all the sections within the Newsfront Admin Area.

Users with other roles such as editor, contributor, or author have limited access to the admin area. Some users such as users with the subscriber role only have access to their profile page inside the admin area.

At the top of each administration screen is the toolbar or admin bar. It provides access to several administrative functions.

Depending on your role you might have less or more options/permissions to perform determined actions.

Each major section typically comes with a sub-menu that can drop-down and expand to show extra options.

The area in the middle of the screen is called the work area. This is where you can write, edit, and delete posts, add media, check scheduled posts as well as adjust profile settings.

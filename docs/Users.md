Note that the Bio field can contain links. We recommend linking to your G+ account (for author support in Google searches).

## Edit other users 
Click the Menu icon and then People to view a full list of all users (admin role only).

Some Editors have a link to Users on their Shortcuts bar.

On the Users page, you can edit multiple users at the same time using the dropdown and checkboxes (even deleting, so be careful).
